#User stories:

1. Users can view all events (index)
2. Users can create a event (new/create)
3. Users can view one event (show)
4. Users can edit a event (edit/update)
5. Users can delete a event (destroy)

Once we have this single Event resource build, we can move onto making an associated RSVP resource.
6. Users can rsvp to events (/rsvps/create, /rsvps/new)
7. Users can cancel their rsvp (/rsvps/destroy)
